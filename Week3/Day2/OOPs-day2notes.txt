---------------------------------------
Abstraction:
-----------
  To hide
  Cannot see
  unable to touch
  Overview
  Hide the internal details which is not required for the user but showing the needed details to them
  
 Interface -Class
 Abstract -Class
 
 
 Any Methods in a class written with a logic 
  Method with body {logic} -->implemented method
 
 
 Interface Class -->design or a blueprint 
        -->No implementation 
		-->100% Abstraction
Purpose of using Interface -->flexibility and modularity

Banking domain
--------------
RBI -->standards/procedure/rules 
    followed by -->National/ Private 
	
	Transcation /loan -->KYC doc,cibil,rate of interest --change 
 
 Method Overriding -->A Concrete class having funtionality /method with body/
 logic is used by the subclass with different implementation 
 
 A interface class having design or unimplemented/method 
 with no body is used by a concrete class by defining logic to it
 
 
 Class extends another class
 interface extends anothor interface
 class implements interface
 class extends abstract class implements interface
 
 
 
 Multiple Inheritace is achevied at interface level
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 what if concrete class doesnt require any one of the method from the interface i.e.
 savings bank doesnt offer loans right , if the loan method implements from interface class 
 ,it will be not required ryt
 
 
 what if I don't want to implement all the methods  which is in interface?
 
 Abstract -Class -->will allow you to use both the design and the implementation --> 0 to 100%  abstraction
  public void transaction(); -->unimplemented method  
  public void activateTransaction(){}-->implemented method
  
 
 ---------------------------------------
 Example for Interface(Java) :
 Collection -->List and Set
 
 length() -->number of characters in a one single string data
 size() -->number of elements in a collection
