Cucumber
--------

3 layers:
--------
Feature
StepDefinition
Runner

Steps to configure cucumber feature
---------------------------
Step:1 Create 3 packages under src/test/java
		feature
		stepDef
		runner
Step:2 Create a feature file  with the extention as .feature under feature package



<dependency>
<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
<artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
<version>7.10.1</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
<artifactId>cucumber-testng</artifactId>
<version>7.10.1</version>
</dependency>
Steps to execute the feature file
-----------------------------------

Step:3 Create a java class under stepDef package
Step:4 Create separate methods with respect to the feature lines/steps
		methodName ->action+webElement
Step:5 Use the Cucumber Annotation to map the feature steps with the respective java methods 		

Step:6 Create a Runner class under runner package
Step:7 extend the Runner class with AbstractTestNGCucumberTests 
Step:8 Annotate the class @CucumberOptions(features={"featurePath"},glue="stepdefPackage",monochrome=true)
Step:9 Execute from the Runner class as TestNg test



Steps for parametrization and Background
-----------------------------------------
Step:1 In Feature file 

Scenario: For invalid credentials
           write the user stories
		   for error message use But  keyword and implement the step in stepdef class
		   
Step:2 -->comment the preCondition steps (launch browser and load url)
        under Feature keyword , define Background: with the preCondition steps

Step:3 in the line of username and password declare the values insid the 
		'demoSalesManager' for positive credentials
		'demo' for invalid field
		 
Step:4  In Java class -
		Parametrize the username and password methods with String arguments and pass it to sendkeys
		In mapping the feature step use {string} to read the data from the feature file
 
 Step:5 Run from the runner class

Steps to do dynamic Parametrization in Cucumber:
-------------------------------------------------
Step:1 Create a feature file for create lead feature

Step:2 Add the Scenario from launch browser to viewLead page with Scenario Outline

Step:3 Use  <> to parametrize the  test data in the respective steps

Step:4 Use Examples : to set the values to the feature step using ||

Step:5 Implement the feature steps in java class

Step:6 Execute from Runner class
