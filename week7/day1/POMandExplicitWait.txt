---------------------------------------------

POM -->sequential 
static driver -->to complete the exe
static is not possible for Parallel exe

How to resolve this?
--------------------
 Constructor -->resolve the issue
 
Steps to execute in Parallel
----------------------------
1.Remove the static keyword for driver
2.Create Parametrized Constructor in each page class and pass the driver as argument
3.Assign the driver to global variable using this 
4.Pass the driver in all the pages methods (return statements) which connect the other page class


Steps to integrate the Excel data:
-----------------------------------
Pre -Requsite ->APache POI library
Excel book

1.Create data folder under Project and add the files 
2.Create a package as utils -->Copy and paste the readExcel class file
3.Copy paste the @DataProvider in ProjectSpecificMethod
4.Create a method as setValue and assign the filename and sheetIndex with respect to the testcase 
  Annotate the method with @BeforeTest
5.Set the dataProvider Attribute the @Test and pass the argument to the respective test methods and in page class also


To handle Multi_Lingual app
------------------------------

Resource -->create file for english and french with .properties
         -->data -->key=value
		  crendentials
		  leads
		  create leads
Step:1 Under ProjectSpecificMethod in preCondition() -->Using FileInputStream -->set the path of the file
Step:2 TO read the data from the Properties file -->instantiate the Properties class and load the filepath into the prop.load()
Step:3 Using prop.getProperty("key")


Explicit wait:
--------------

Implicit wait-->internal/global wait  -->applicable for all findelement and findelements
Thread.sleep(ms)-->java wait -->pause the execution -->explicit wait
                -->slows down the execution
Selenium -->WebDriverWait-->explicit wait-->Conditional wait
presence of element
stale element
ele click


Syntax:
WebDriverWait wait=new WebDriverWait(driver,Duration.ofSeconds(10))

10 sec -->500ms default -revisiting on element
if not the condition is satisfied -->TimeOut exception
